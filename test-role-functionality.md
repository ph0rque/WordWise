# Quick Role Functionality Test

## Test the Fixed Role System

### 1. Test Student Registration
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter email: `student@test.com` and password: `password123`
4. Select "Student" role
5. Check for successful signup (should get email confirmation message)

### 2. Test Role Hook (Console Check)
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Look for any errors in console
3. Should NOT see "Error fetching user role: {}" anymore
4. Should see role-related logs showing proper role detection

### 3. Test Navigation
1. After signup, the interface should show:
   - Role-based header with "Academic Writing Assistant"
   - No auth errors in console
   - Proper role-based UI elements

### 4. Test Admin Flow
1. Try admin signup with `admin@test.com`
2. Select "Admin" role
3. Should redirect to admin dashboard after email confirmation

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "Error fetching user role: {}" errors
- ✅ Role detection works from user metadata
- ✅ Proper role-based redirects
- ✅ UI shows appropriate content for each role

## If Issues Persist
- Check browser console for any remaining errors
- Verify Supabase environment variables are set
- Check if email confirmation is working
