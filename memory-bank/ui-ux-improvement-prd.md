# **WordWise UI/UX Improvement PRD**
*Simplifying the Interface for High School Students*

---

## **Project Overview**

This PRD outlines the user interface improvements needed to transform the current busy, cluttered WordWise interface into a clean, intuitive writing environment specifically designed for high school students. The goal is to reduce cognitive load while maintaining all essential functionality.

**Target User:** High school students (ages 14-18) writing academic essays  
**Primary Goal:** Create a distraction-free writing environment with contextual AI assistance  
**Design Principle:** One primary action at a time, with help available when needed

---

## **Current State Analysis**

### **Problems Identified:**
- Too many navigation elements competing for attention
- Redundant UI components (multiple top bars, scattered controls)
- Information overload in sidebars (12+ distinct sections)
- Intimidating consent/recording notifications during writing
- Complex navigation structure (6+ tabs)
- Academic jargon that may confuse students

### **User Impact:**
- Students struggle to find basic functions
- Writing flow interrupted by interface complexity  
- Anxiety from prominent recording notifications
- Cognitive overload preventing focus on actual writing

---

## **Design Goals**

### **Primary Objectives:**
1. **Maximize writing space** - prioritize the text editor
2. **Minimize distractions** - remove unnecessary UI elements
3. **Contextual assistance** - show relevant tools when needed
4. **Double-column layout** - eliminate left sidebar entirely, leaving the main panel and the right sidebar only
5. **Progressive disclosure** - reveal complexity only when requested
