# Active Context

## Current Project State
WordWise is a functional grammar-checking application with core features implemented. The application is currently operational with both AI-powered and rule-based grammar checking capabilities. **Recent authentication issues have been resolved**, and the admin functionality is now working properly.

## Recent Work & Changes
**December 2024 - Authentication System Fix ✅ COMPLETED**

### Critical Bug Fix - Admin Authentication & RLS Infinite Recursion
**Problem Resolved**: Admin users were experiencing authentication errors when trying to add students via the admin interface.

**Root Cause Identified**: Two-part authentication issue:
1. **Client-Server Session Sync**: Client-side Supabase storing auth tokens in localStorage, but server-side API routes expecting authentication via cookies
2. **RLS Infinite Recursion**: Row Level Security policies on `user_roles` table causing infinite loops when checking admin permissions

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Client-Side Session Management**: Modified `lib/supabase/client.ts` to automatically store auth tokens in cookies alongside localStorage
2. **Upgraded Server-Side Authentication**: Made `createClient()` async and enhanced cookie reading capabilities  
3. **Fixed RLS Infinite Recursion**: Updated admin API routes to use service role client (`supabaseAdmin`) that bypasses RLS for admin operations
4. **Improved Middleware**: Enhanced session validation and refresh token handling

**Technical Details of RLS Fix**:
- The `user_roles` table had RLS policies that checked `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')`
- This created infinite recursion: to check if user is admin → query user_roles → trigger RLS policy → check if user is admin → loop
- Solution: Use service role client for admin permission checks, bypassing RLS entirely
- Admin operations now use `supabaseAdmin` client with elevated privileges

**Files Modified in This Fix**:
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` - Added cookie-based session persistence
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` - Async authentication with cookie reading
- `middleware.ts` - Enhanced session management
- `app/api/admin/students/assign-role/route.ts` - Fixed async auth + RLS bypass with service role
- `app/api/admin/students/route.ts` - Fixed async auth + RLS bypass with service role
- `app/api/admin/stats/route.ts` - Fixed async auth + RLS bypass with service role
- `app/api/account/delete/route.ts` - Fixed async auth
- Multiple other API routes updated

**Impact**: ✅ Admin users can now successfully add students without authentication or permission errors

   - **Text Overflow Prevention**: Added proper text wrapping and overflow handling to prevent content from breaking layout
   - **Enhanced Readability**: AI responses with structured content (lists, emphasis) now display beautifully formatted
   - **Technical Implementation**:
     - Created custom markdown parser for **bold** and *italic* text
     - Added support for bullet point lists (•, -, *, ·)
     - Implemented proper paragraph and list structure parsing
     - Added `break-words`, `min-w-0`, and `overflow-hidden` classes for text overflow prevention
   - **Files Modified**: `components/tutor/chat-message.tsx`
   - **Impact**: ✅ AI responses are now properly formatted and never overflow, making them much more readable and professional

2. **Fixed Grammar Tooltip Positioning** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Problem Resolved**: Grammar suggestion tooltips were getting cut off at the bottom of the screen
   - **Smart Positioning**: Tooltips now automatically position above the text when there's insufficient space below
   - **Enhanced UX**: Added visual indicators (colored borders) to show tooltip direction and prevent horizontal overflow
   - **Technical Details**:
     - Measures available space above and below target element
     - Calculates tooltip dimensions before positioning
     - Ensures tooltips stay within viewport boundaries
     - Added safeguards for horizontal positioning to prevent off-screen tooltips
   - **Files Modified**: `components/text-editor.tsx`
   - **Impact**: ✅ Grammar tooltips are now always fully visible and accessible regardless of text position

2. **Enhanced AI Tutor Interface & Context** ✅ **COMPLETED**

   - **Enhanced Document Context**: 
     - Fixed missing `documentContent` prop in RightSidebar → ChatPanel connection
     - Enhanced AI prompt to include actual document content preview (up to 500 characters)
     - AI now receives specific content context for targeted feedback and suggestions
   - **Technical Changes**:
     - Removed unused Badge import from ChatPanel component
     - Updated prompt system to include document content preview with metadata
     - AI can now reference specific content for structure, clarity, and writing improvement guidance

   - **Impact**: ✅ Cleaner UI and AI can now provide specific, contextual feedback about the actual document content

2. **Fixed Scrolling Issues with Long Content** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Problem Resolved**: Users couldn't scroll up and down easily when they had a lot of content in the editor
   - **Root Cause**: Layout containers used `overflow-hidden` and had conflicting height constraints that prevented proper scrolling
   - **Solution Applied**:
     - Replaced `overflow-hidden` with `min-h-0` for proper flex container behavior
     - Added `flex-shrink-0` to headers to prevent them from shrinking
     - Fixed nested scroll containers in TextEditor, RightSidebar, and ChatPanel
     - Ensured proper scroll hierarchy: main container → editor container → content editor
   - **Files Modified**: `app/page.tsx`, `components/text-editor.tsx`, `components/sidebar/right-sidebar.tsx`, `components/tutor/chat-panel.tsx`
   - **Impact**: ✅ Users can now scroll smoothly through long documents and chat conversations

2. **Major UI/UX Improvements Sprint - COMMITTED & PUSHED** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Current Challenges

### 1. Component Size & Complexity
The main TextEditor component handles too many responsibilities:
- Text editing logic
- Suggestion management  
- Document CRUD operations
- Settings management
- Auto-save functionality

**Recommended Approach**: Extract specialized hooks and sub-components

### 2. UI/UX Improvement Implementation
**Status**: Ready to continue after authentication fix
**Focus Areas**: 
- Header simplification for students
- Sidebar consolidation  
- Distraction-free writing environment
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Reference: `memory-bank/ui-ux-improvement-prd.md`

### 3. User Experience Gaps
- Loading states could be more informative
- Error messages need better user-friendly formatting  
- Suggestion acceptance could provide better feedback
- Mobile experience needs optimization

## Next Steps
