# Active Context

## Current Project State
WordWise is a functional grammar-checking application with core features implemented. The application is currently operational with both AI-powered and rule-based grammar checking capabilities.

## Recent Work & Changes
Based on the current codebase, the following major components are implemented:

### Completed Features
1. **Core Text Editor**: Fully functional with real-time grammar checking
2. **Suggestion System**: Multi-type suggestions (grammar, spelling, style, clarity, tone)
3. **Document Management**: CRUD operations for user documents
4. **Authentication**: Supabase-based user authentication
5. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration with fallback to basic checking
6. **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library integration

### Current Architecture Status
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 ✅
- **Backend**: API routes for grammar checking ✅
- **Database**: Supabase integration for documents ✅
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design ✅
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage ✅

## Active Development Focus

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Code Quality**: Review and optimize existing implementations
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error boundaries and user feedback
3. **Performance**: Profile and optimize suggestion processing
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage

### Technical Debt Areas
1. **Component Complexity**: TextEditor component is large (852 lines)
2. **State Management**: Could benefit from context or state management library
3. **API Optimization**: Grammar checking could be more efficient
4. **Error Recovery**: More robust handling of API failures

## Current Challenges

### 1. Component Size & Complexity
The main TextEditor component handles too many responsibilities:
- Text editing logic
- Suggestion management
- Document CRUD operations
- Settings management
- Auto-save functionality

**Recommended Approach**: Extract specialized hooks and sub-components

### 2. Grammar Checking Performance
Current implementation may make too many API calls:
- 1.5-second debounce helps but could be optimized
- Suggestion filtering logic could be more efficient
- Caching strategy could be improved

### 3. User Experience Gaps
- Loading states could be more informative
- Error messages need better user-friendly formatting
- Suggestion acceptance could provide better feedback

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Refactor TextEditor**: Extract custom hooks for:
   - Document management
   - Suggestion handling
   - Auto-save logic
   - Settings management

2. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Add error boundaries
   - Improve API error messages
   - Add retry mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement better suggestion caching
   - Optimize re-rendering patterns
   - Profile grammar checking performance

### Medium-term (Next month)
1. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Unit tests for utility functions
   - Integration tests for API routes
   - E2E tests for critical user flows

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Document templates
   - Export functionality
   - Advanced text statistics
   - Writing goals and tracking

3. **Major UI/UX Overhaul for Students**:
   - Implement the comprehensive redesign outlined in the UI/UX Improvement PRD.
   - **Reference**: `memory-bank/ui-ux-improvement-prd.md`
   - Key goals include header simplification, sidebar consolidation, and a distraction-free writing environment.

## Key Decisions Needed

### 1. State Management Strategy
**Question**: Should we introduce a state management library (Zustand, Context API) or continue with prop drilling?
**Impact**: Affects component architecture and data flow
**Timeline**: Decide within next sprint

### 2. Testing Strategy
**Question**: What testing framework and coverage targets should we establish?
**Options**: Jest + Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
**Timeline**: Establish framework this week

### 3. Performance Monitoring
**Question**: Should we implement performance monitoring and analytics?
**Options**: Vercel Analytics, custom metrics, third-party tools
**Timeline**: Research and decide next week

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### External Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: Optional but enhances functionality
- **Supabase**: Critical for auth and data persistence
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform dependency

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Suggestion accuracy and relevance
- Response time for grammar checking
- Document save/load performance
- User session duration

### Technical Metrics
- API response times
- Error rates
- Bundle size optimization
- Core Web Vitals scores

## Notes & Observations
- The application already has a strong foundation with modern React patterns
- AI integration is well-implemented with proper fallbacks
- Code quality is generally good with TypeScript coverage
- Architecture is scalable and follows Next.js best practices
