/**
 * Unit tests for role management functions
 * 
 * Note: These tests are designed to run with Jest. 
 * To run tests, ensure Jest is configured in your project:
 * 
 * 1. Install Jest dependencies:
 *    npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest
 * 
 * 2. Add jest.config.js to project root:
 *    module.exports = {
 *      preset: 'ts-jest',
 *      testEnvironment: 'node',
 *      moduleNameMapping: {
 *        '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/$1'
 *      }
 *    }
 * 
 * 3. Run tests with: npx jest lib/auth/roles.test.ts

// Test cases that would be implemented with Jest:

/**
 * Test: getCurrentUserRole()
 * - Should return user role when authenticated
 * - Should return null when not authenticated
 * - Should return "student" as default when no role is set
 * - Should handle database errors gracefully
 */

/**
 * Test: getCurrentUserWithRole()
 * - Should return user with role and permissions
 * - Should return null when not authenticated
 * - Should include proper permission mapping for roles
 */

/**
 * Test: hasRole()
 * - Should return true when user has required role
 * - Should return false when user does not have required role
 */

/**
 * Test: hasPermission()
 * - Should return true when user has required permission
 * - Should return false when user does not have required permission
 */

/**
 * Test: requireRole()
 * - Should not throw when user has required role
 * - Should throw when user does not have required role
 */

/**
 * Test: checkRoleAuth()
 * - Should return authorized true for valid admin token
 * - Should return authorized false for missing token
 * - Should return authorized false for student requesting admin access
 */

/**
 * Test: updateUserRole()
 * - Should update user role when called by admin
 * - Should throw error when called by non-admin
 */

/**
 * Test: getAllUsersWithRoles()
 * - Should return all users with roles for admin
 * - Should throw error for non-admin users
